Sampling


# Quest 1 Seeing Potential
We are tasked to use the Analog to Digital Converter(ADC) on the board to get a potentionmeter(variable resistor)
To start we need to turn on the correct pin. I have decided to use pin 33(ADC1_5).

The code shows how to set up and continuous ADC reader and a single simple version.

To read from serial monitor use the defaults which is a baudrate 115200 and teh same port used for flashing.
No Uart setup needed for only reading.

# Quest 2 Guessing Game
Pretty much a waste of time, most of it was not reading ADC it was how to handling user input,
which is now a good guide to understand, for example an easier workflow for uart communcation
for future tasks has been made. Use this for look up not try and dcode the deeper meanings XD.
